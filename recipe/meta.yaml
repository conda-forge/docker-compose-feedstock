  summary: Define and run multi-container applications with Docker
  description: |
    Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications
    on Docker defined using the Compose file format.
    A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that
    make up your application are configured. Once you have a Compose
    file, you can create and start your application with a single command:
    docker compose up.
